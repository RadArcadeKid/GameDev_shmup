# Game Development Progress - SHMUP 

This is designed to track the progress of my shmup game  


### Brainstorming Ideas, initial setup

I originally had quite a few ideas when it came to building this whole shmup from the ground up, however, what I did know was that it was going to be music based, because I have a passion for music and sound. So, eventually, I stumbled upon the idea of making the shmup where you're a concert attendee who must survive a series of **EVIL BANDS** who attack the player to music-timed projectiles. I've thought about doing this as a first-person shooter for a while, but I think a rythm-based 3rd-person shmup lends itself much better to this idea. Instead of suriving through waves of enemies on a moving platform like most shmups, you're trapped in a concert venue, and the goal of this is to create a big boss battle wherre you move around the concert floor and attempt to shoot the moving DJ's up top. 
The USP of this game is that the projectiles are all timed to music - so if you've got a song playing, the drummer's projecticles are timed to the drums of a song, the guitarists are shot in time with the music. Each of the band members' projectiles will be different, too, but all will be timed to the music. 
I am also planning on adding more bands and even a DJ depending on the style of the music. Electronic music is repetative and lends itself well to something like this. 
As far as the visual-style goes, I think this lends itself well to a top-down pixel-art setting. I *could* do this with 3D renders but I think the visual style and presentation would be more fun with pixel-art.

# Change Log: 

## 9/25/2019
Started work on Shmup project using the book as a reference. Added basic movement, placeholder assets, 
Because my game is different than the one being built,
I'm attempting to scope it a little differently than the one the author is building. 

#### Key differences: 
* Has square boundaries instead of a rectangle
* The player moves in x and y and does not rotate or move along the z axis
* There is no shield mechanic (doesn't fit what I'm going for right now)
* The player movement is more tight and fast rather than weighty and heavy 
* Does not have paralax scrolling
* Has enemies timed to/spawning to music/timing
* Does not have powerups (yet)

I also still need to implement more assets and get the game looking how I want. Currently using placeholder assets and basic stuff to get the mechanics down first.
#### Stretch-goals: 
* Make it pretty (add real assets + art)
* Add more solid movement mechanics to enemies 
* Figure out a way to restrict the player's movement based on the arena (better boundaries) 
* Have enemies moving across the top of the screen on a stage, rather than spawning in
* (Long-term goal) Implement a rewind/music based powerup which lets the player rewind/stop time for a few seconds

Initialized this repository, created basic game files. (Recreated because I did it really wrong the first time)
