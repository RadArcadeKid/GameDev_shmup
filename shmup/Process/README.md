# Game Development Progress - SHMUP 

This is designed to track the progress of my shmup game  

## 9/25/2019

Started work on Shmup project using the book as a reference. Added basic movement, placeholder assets, 
Because my game is different than the one being built,
I'm attempting to scope it a little differently than the one the author is building. 

#### Key differences: 
* Has square boundaries instead of a rectangle
* The player moves in x and y and does not rotate or move along the z axis
* There is no shield mechanic (doesn't fit what I'm going for right now)
* The player movement is more tight and fast rather than weighty and heavy 
* Does not have paralax scrolling
* Has enemies timed to/spawning to music/timing
* Does not have powerups (yet)

I also still need to implement more assets and get the game looking how I want. Currently using placeholder assets and basic stuff to get the mechanics down first.
#### Stretch-goals: 
* Make it pretty (add real assets + art)
* Add more solid movement mechanics to enemies 
* Figure out a way to restrict the player's movement based on the arena
* Have enemies moving across the top of the screen on a stage, rather than spawning in
* (Long-term goal) Implement a rewind/music based powerup which lets the player rewind/stop time for a few seconds
