# Final Entry - 10/21/2019
* There are now multiple enemies on the board - 
* ALL have thier own unique music tracks, projectilies, and THEY SPAWN TO THE MUSIC 
* Enemies all have their own unique movement system
* More aesthetically pleaing and clear health bars
* Assets are now actual art instead of more placeholders
* There is an audience the player can shove-around and interact with at a very basic level (more for visual aesthetics than anything else) 
* Adjusted difficultly curve to make the shmup easier to play
* Ironed out some bugs and weird boundary issues I had with collision 


### Notes on the final build:
It turned into way-more of a bullet-hell than I was expecting! Regradless, I feel like this absolutely put *much* more of an emphasis on survival and quick-thinking dodging + strategy than I was expecting. Honestly though, this plays into the design goal of making the player feel overwhelmed, which I really like. It encourages survival and quick-timing thinking with dodging the variety of projectiles. 
Also - there's so many other little small mechanics I wanted to add that I simply just did not have time for...I really wanted to expand on this with multiple levels/songs, weird powerups, and more interesting ways to have the enemies interact. The final product is nice, but it's not where I totally wanted it to be! I had an idea where the player could replenish health with a vending machine, obtain "earplugs" to pause the music or that would clear all projectiles. Oh well.
I also wanted to expand on the idea of making it more rythm-based (i.e. the player could only shoot to the beat, or move to the beat).
